# Description

Firewall on Demand applies, via Netconf, flow rules to a network device.
These rules are then propagated via e-bgp to peering routers. Each user
is authenticated against shibboleth. Authorization is performed via a
combination of a Shibboleth attribute and the peer network address range
that the user originates from. FoD is meant to operate over this
architecture:

```
    +-----------+          +------------+        +------------+  
    |   FoD     | NETCONF  | flowspec   | ebgp   |   router   |  
    | web app   +----------> device     +-------->            |  
    +-----------+          +------+-----+        +------------+  
                                  | ebgp  
                                  |  
                           +------v-----+  
                           |   router   |  
                           |            |  
                           +------------+  
```

NETCONF is chosen as the mgmt protocol to apply rules to a single
flowspec capable device. Rules are then propagated via igbp to all
flowspec capable routers. Of course FoD could apply rules directly (via
NETCONF always) to a router and then ibgp would do the rest. In GRNET’s
case the flowspec capable device is an EX4200.

> ** Attention **
>
> Make sure your FoD server has SSH access to your flowspec device.
