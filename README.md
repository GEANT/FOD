#Firewall on Demand#

##Description##

Firewall on Demand applies via NETCONF, flow rules to a network
device. These rules are then propagated via e-bgp to peering routers.
Each user is authenticated against shibboleth. Authorization is
performed via a combination of a Shibboleth attribute and the peer
network address range that the user originates from. FoD is meant to
operate over this architecture:

       +-----------+          +------------+        +------------+
       |   FoD     | NETCONF  | flowspec   | ebgp   |   router   |
       | web app   +----------> device     +-------->            |
       +-----------+          +------+-----+        +------------+
                                     | ebgp
                                     |
                              +------v-----+
                              |   router   |
                              |            |
                              +------------+


NETCONF is chosen as the mgmt protocol to apply rules to a single
flowspec capable device. Rules are then propagated via igbp to all
flowspec capable routers. Of course FoD could apply rules directly
(via NETCONF always) to a router and then ibgp would do the rest. In
GRNET's case the flowspec capable device is an EX4200.

**Attention**: Make sure your FoD server has ssh access to your flowspec device.

##Installation Considerations##


You can find the installation instructions for Debian Wheezy (64)
with Django 1.4.x at [Flowspy documentation](http://flowspy.readthedocs.org).
If upgrading from a previous version bear in mind the changes introduced in Django 1.4.
