#Firewall on Demand#

##Description##

Firewall on Demand applies via NETCONF, flow rules to a network
device. These rules are then propagated via e-bgp to peering routers.
Each user is authenticated against shibboleth. Authorization is
performed via a combination of a Shibboleth attribute and the peer
network address range that the user originates from. FoD is meant to
operate over this architecture:

       +-----------+          +------------+        +------------+
       |   FoD     | NETCONF  | flowspec   | ebgp   |   router   |
       | web app   +----------> device     +-------->            |
       +-----------+          +------+-----+        +------------+
                                     | ebgp
                                     |
                              +------v-----+
                              |   router   |
                              |            |
                              +------------+


NETCONF is chosen as the mgmt protocol to apply rules to a single
flowspec capable device. Rules are then propagated via igbp to all
flowspec capable routers. Of course FoD could apply rules directly
(via NETCONF always) to a router and then ibgp would do the rest. In
GRNET's case the flowspec capable device is an EX4200.

**Attention**: Make sure your FoD server has ssh access to your flowspec device.

##Installation Considerations##

You can find the installation instructions for Debian Wheezy (64)
with Django 1.4.x at [Flowspy documentation](http://flowspy.readthedocs.org).
If upgrading from a previous version bear in mind the changes introduced in Django 1.4.


##Rest Api##
FoD provides a rest api. It uses token as authentication method.

### Generating Tokens
A user can generate a token for his account on "my profile" page from FoD's
UI. Then by using this token in the header of the request he can list, retrieve,
modify and create rules.

### Example Usage
Here are some examples:

#### GET items
- List all the rules your user has created (admin users can see all the rules)

            curl -X GET https://fod.example.com/api/routes/ -H 'Authorization: Token <Your users token>'

- Retrieve a specific rule:

            curl -X GET https://fod.example.com/api/routes/<rule_id>/ -H 'Authorization: Token <Your users token>'

- In order to create or modify a rule you have to use POST/PUT methods.

#### POST/PUT rules
In order to update or create rules you can follow this example:

##### Foreign Keys
In order to create/modify a rule you have to connect the rule with some foreign keys:

###### Ports, Fragmentypes, protocols, thenactions
When creating a rule, one can specify:

- source port
- destination port
- port (if source = destination)

That can be done by getting the url of the desired port instance from `/api/ports/<port_id>/`

Same with Fragmentypes in `/api/fragmenttypes/<fragmenttype_id>/`, protocols in `/api/matchprotocol/<protocol_id>/` and then actions in `/api/thenactions/<action_id>/`.

Since we have the urls we want to connect with the rule we want to create, we can make a POST request like the following:


      curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Token <Your users token>' -F "name=Example" -F "comments=Description" -F "source=0.0.0.0/0" -F "sourceport=https://fod.example.com/api/ports/7/" -F "destination=203.0.113.12" https://fod.example.com/api/routes/

And here is a PUT request example:

      curl -X PUT -F "name=Example" -F "comments=Description" -F "source=0.0.0.0/0" -F "sourceport=https://fod.example.com/api/ports/7/" -F "destination=83.212.9.93" https://fod.example.com/api/routes/12/ -H  'Authorization: Token <Your users token>'
